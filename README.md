# Customer Churn Analysis – Data-Driven Retention Strategy

It is a data analytics solution focused on identifying customer attrition patterns, predicting churn, and providing actionable business insights to enhance retention strategies. 

This project demonstrates how data can be leveraged to improve customer engagement, reduce revenue leakage, and drive profitability, especially in industries like manufacturing, retail, distribution, airlines and many more.

# Project Overview
